Description: Several functions to extract and describe and analyse 
  the morphological characteristics of the leaf epidermis. Features include cell 
  angle, number of stomatal rows, undulation index, maximum amplitude of cell 
  wall undulations. Pavement cells can be separated according to how close to 
  stomata they are. Also includes functions to evaluate 
  intra-individual/intra-species variability and calculate optimal sampling effort.
