# epidermalmorph

Quantifying and analysing epidermal cell shape, size and spatial arrangement. 

## Overview
Leaf epidermal cells display a complex suite of phenotypic characters that can be affected by phylogeny, environment or some combination of the two. This package includes functions to quantify this variation by measuring a wide range of traits including cell area, aspect ratio and angle as well as several novel shape descriptors and functions to optimise sampling effort and evaluate intra-specific or intra-individual variation. 

## Installation
We hope to have epidermalmorph on CRAN soon. In the meantime, it can be installed via GitHub:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matildabrown/epidermalmorph")
```

## Usage 
See the vignette for an example workflow:

```
